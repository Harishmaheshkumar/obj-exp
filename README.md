# traffic-light-control
a simple python model to count number of vehicles in different lanes and  stored as .csv
# REQUIREMENTS
Python 3.8
PyQt5
Sys
Os
Time
Opencv
Numpy
Pandas
You can install these libraries in a separate env or directly into the system.
# working
Open the folder under cmd and the below command.

  ``python myapp.py``
The “myapp.py” is the main python file which connects all the modules. After running this command the below image will pop up(wait for few minutes it will take some time for the model to compile).
Now browse for the particular traffic footage that you want analyse and wait for it to analyse. Now you will realise the project is done.
[This video will show you how to run](https://youtu.be/Ku3TSja-_Ro).
[This will give you the guide to run the model](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/object-detection-with-python-42272ca27ef4).
# FUTURE
The counts are stored in excel sheet as csv files.Now we can create a traffic simulator using matlab to regulate the traffic light(signal) control according to the count.
